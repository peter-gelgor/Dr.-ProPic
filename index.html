            <p>Think you're more attractive than your friends say?
                <br> Or maybe you just want the best photos for your dating profile? Or even both!?
                <br>Well you're in luck!

            <p>We get it, you're probably scrolling through you're camera roll looking for your best Brad Pitt or Gal Gadot look alike, but like most, we can't tell whether your latest selfie or a picture from Ibiza will target your audience better.
                <br>
                <br>
                Most likely, the Ibiza pic would be preferable, but who knows if you're a one out of ten.
                <br>
                Our platform is for everyone and we encourage you all to join us in our quest to help you achieve your dream or not being an ugly fat cow ;).</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Dr. ProPic is a state-of-the-art technology which rates your attractiveness out of 10 to help pick which photo would attract the most dimes. We use AI and human judgement to ensure that we can accurately tell you
                that you should hit the gym and/or a plastic surgeon.</p>
            <p>Using cutting-edge technology and Microsoft Azure's machine learning model creation tools, we developed a neural network to classify and quantify an attractiveness rating to be assigned to a person based on
                <br>user-submitted photos. </p>
            <p>Based on training data from an intricate data set of 1000 faces and their attractiveness ratings, our machine learning model classifies pictures based on Microsoft's Vision API to design a program to quantify subjective
            attractiveness ratings over a set of criteria. </p>
